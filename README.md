# Non_hermitian_skin_effect_simulation
This is a project on theoretical condense matter physics project supervised by Professor Ching Hua Lee. The aim of this project is to realize non-Hermitian skin effect for Nelson-Hatano (NH) and Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) model on a digital quantum computer. For the quantum simulation part, Qiskit and Quimb packages are used.
